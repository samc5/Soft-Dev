DISCO (PREDICT):
- .cgi-bin directory: (common gateway interface - binary), triggered
  a run from Apache
- fstoD: "slightly wonky format to dictionaries you know and love" - Mykolyk
- "from flask import request" is new, enables interaction betweem HTML and
  Python (in the direction of HTML to Python)?
- "import a, b, c", how to import multiple libraries in one line
- Further detailed line predictions, see app.py
- app.run(port=####) changes the port, meaning you can have two different
  servers running on two different ports --> goods for comparisons
