        <p>Stuyvesant High School offers one of the country’s most innovative and exciting computer science programs. The goal of our program is not to create programmers but rather to show our students the power of computer science as a problem solving technique. To that end, our classes exposes students to a variety of programming languages and paradigms. Our students learn that there is no “best” language or tool, but will understand the power of finding the best tool for a given task.Courses in our program start with the assumption that students have never been exposed to computer science, though those coming in with experience will be shown different ways to look at the field.</p>
