Predictions about value-added KTS
Big 600 by 600 box in the middle of the screen:
if toggle button is set to rect, user can drag out rectangles with their mouse on the canvas
if its circ, the same except with circles
Clear button will wipe the box clean
Reality:
There's no drag/drop. It spawns a rect with the mouse at the top left of the rect, and a circle with mouse in the center
circ/rect button is originally rect/circ - each time you click it it toggles between circle and rectangle
