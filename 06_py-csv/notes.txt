two dictionaries - dictionary and count
.strip to get rid of the quotes in pieceing back together occupations w/ commas in them
get rid of total (in a nicer way than an if)
counting down instead of doing our whole sum variable thing
uses random.uniform as we did to be inclusive of total
clean test printline

\(backslash) in python aware editor helps w/ formatting
