Diana/Russell/Kevin:

str.rsplit(delimiter, maximum) looks extremely useful for this specific problem but not as much for others, interesting
another .pop() user

3 dictionaries, different storage system
random.choice, not entirely sure now it works

Gabriel/Gitae

Similarly used running sum
split by number of things instead of importing csv
Mentioned .pop() which can remove and return something from a list. Would clean up code
