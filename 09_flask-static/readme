One day, a wondering trio by the name of "Blinking Holly Fountains" stumble
across a mysterious static folder, filled to the rim with two strange files, 
foo and foo.html. They looked at the special .html file extension and,
from some wisdom from a knowledgeable source long ago, predicted that the
foo file would return an error, and the foo.html file would render something.
They then used a spell of python3 to run the app.py file that was found in
a nearby corner outside the folder and as they predicted, only foo.html
rendered. 

Containing a scroll in hand, they proceeded to write some more in an empty
file they found next to foo.html, for which they named "fixie.html" and
filled it with words, some they knew by heart, and some they knew from
that knowledgeable source long ago. They then found with creation on
http://localhost:5000/static/fixie.html .
