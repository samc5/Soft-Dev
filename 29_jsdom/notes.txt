DISCO:
- To get button working, the fabled second argument is a function name, but not a call [no `()`]
- You can make basically f strings with backticks for quotes and $ in front of objects
- `.textContent` to update the content of a tag w/ text
QCC:
- Why does JS have all this weird syntax and whatnot?
- Does order matter for anything in js?
