Diana/Russell/Kevin:

Used tuple instead of dictionary inside dictionary. Not necessarily better, just different

Anna/Aden

Separately filled keys and value lists as opposed to making dictionary and then getting keys and values

Gabriel/Gitae

Used devo as outer dictionary instead of pd and dictionary of lists instead of dict of dicts
Not especially important in the swing of things
