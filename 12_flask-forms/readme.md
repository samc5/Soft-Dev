DISCO:
- A 405 error is returned when you attempt to use "post"\
 unless you add a method="post" attribute to the form tag in HTML file
- Whether there exists a methods argument in app.route("/") (root/localhost) does not seem to matter, nor does what is in it.  
- GET is used for requests by default
- Discos of get vs post are located on response page

QCC:

- Is there a clear/definitive answer of the differences between get and post?
- In what scenarios are GET and POST preferred over one another
- What's up with other types of requests? Do they have to be listed as attributes of the form in the HTML file like POST is?
