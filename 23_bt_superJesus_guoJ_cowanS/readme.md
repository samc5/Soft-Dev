K23 -- Working With Bootstrap CSS and CDNs
2022-11-29
time spent: .8 hrs

###DISCO:
- You can just link and use the bootstrap code without having it downloaded
- Many features within Bootstrap can be linked without breakage
- JS is needed in many of the features 
- navbar, button (both with dropdown)
- Tables (colored and formatted)
- navbar
- spinner
- form
- card  
###QCC:
- How does the colored table feature work?
- Bootstrap has some finicky image sizing formats
