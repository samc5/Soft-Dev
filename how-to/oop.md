# how-to :: Use Object Oriented Programming in Python
---
## Overview
OOP allows us to assign common attributes (variables and methods) to a group of things, allowing us to use the same code instead of rewriting over and over for each object. It also lets us hide implementation details from the user (preventing them from destroying things like the mindless animals they are), and to create multiple methods (that do and take in different inputs) with the same name. 

To break it down: 
- Abstraction 
- Encapsulation 
- Inheritance 
- Polymorphism 

### Estimated Time Cost: Depends on the program in question

### Prerequisites:

- You should have Python installed on your machine 
- Have a text-editor (atom, thonny, notepad, etc)
- You need an understanding of basic python syntax
    - Variables
    - Methods
    - Fundamental Datatypes (Integers, Floats, Characters, Booleans, Strings, Arrays)
- Decent File Management

### Building Python Objects:
1. class keyword
```
class
```
2. __init__
3. self

### Class Inheritance:
