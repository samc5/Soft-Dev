K10: Just Plug It In

time spent: tbd

TLDR (DISCO): 

INITIAL QUESTIONS:
- render_template? What is that?
- "/my_foist_template" instead of "/"
- "What is happening with this thing?" - Sam
- Are the braces inputting data from python?

PREDICTIONS:
- "It will cause an error, traceback error" - Sam
- You can access the html file "model_tmplt.html" at 
  localhost/myfoist_template
- The braces have to do with the variables within the render_template

POST-PREDICTIONS:
- ROOT: "No hablo queso!"
- /my_foist_template: loop of numbers from the coll variable in app.py
- "Fake Python? What is this?" - Sam
- For loop in HTML?
- Double brackets
- fooooo title!
- "endfor"? :O
- Variables are placed in double brackets within the HTML file
- endfor signifies the end of the for loop. Percent symbols have
  something to do with the for loop.
