## DISCO:
- An HTML grid is usually divided into 12 columns. This was one of the things plaguing us last night when using bootstrap cards and carousel.
  - This also makes resizing for different windows size a possibility
- Forms in Foundation appear to have a simpler syntax (more is done behind the scenes, which makes life easier but customization harder)
## QCC:
- The frameworks are very similar (syntax, components, cdn) in terms of CSS
- Are the JS capabilities of these two FEFs going to differentiate the two more?
